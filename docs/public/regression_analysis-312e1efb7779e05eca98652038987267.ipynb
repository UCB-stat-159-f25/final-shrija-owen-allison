    "With an accuracy of 72% our model proved capable but certainly not perfect. Our confusion matrix gave us a slightly more informative picture into where our model worked well: of all graduates, only 19 were misclassified as dropouts. On the other hand, our model misclassified more dropouts as graduates than it was able to correctly label. In other words, and as our precision and recall further confirm as well, our model was very good at identifying all true graduates but labeled too many students as graduates as a consequence. While these results are also certainly impacted by the randomness of our sampled data and the randomness of our training and test split while building our model, it left us with an informative conclusion: our selected student factors (age at enrollment, if they're a debtor, and if they're tuition fees are up to date) all are better for a model intended to predict if a student will graduate, rather than identify students at risk of dropping out of school. This conclusion is clear given our model's bias towards predicting a student will graduate, and failure to effectively find which students would go on to drop out of school."
