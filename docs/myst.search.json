doesn’t seem to correlate to graduation rate, age at enrollment, tuition fees, or qualification and admission grades. The only variable that seems to have a relation to the parent’s education level was whether or not the student had a scholarship, however our limited amount of data made it difficult to find a strong correlation between the two. We can also see that the Mother data was similar to the Father data. This suprised all of us as we expected the parent’s education level to impact the student because in a lot of instances a parent’s education level tends to indicate whether the family is lower, middle, or upper class, which then can influence whether or not a student chooses to continue with their college education. Due to the fact that we could not see any correlation, we decided to go ahead and conduct our regression analysis on how “Age of Enrollment”, “Debtor”, and “Tuition Fees Up to Date”, predicted the “Target” (whether or not the student graduated).","type":"content","url":"/parent-eda#analysis","position":51},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Logistic Regression Model"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/regression-analysis","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Logistic Regression Model"},"content":"In this notebook, we wanted to see how accurate of a logostic model we could make using our most significant variables from our exploratory analysis.

Our confusion matrix gave us a slightly more informative picture into where our model worked well: of all graduates, only 19 were misclassified as dropouts. On the other hand, our model misclassified more dropouts as graduates than it was able to correctly label. In other words, and as our precision and recall further confirm as well, our model was very good at identifying all true graduates but labeled too many students as graduates as a consequence. While these results are also certainly impacted by the randomness of our sampled data and the randomness of our training and test split while building our model, it left us with an informative conclusion: our selected student factors (age at enrollment, if they’re a debtor, and if they’re tuition fees are up to date) all are better for a model intended to predict if a student will graduate, rather than identify students at risk of dropping out of school.

For those students, there does not appear to be any significant relationship between their “Previous Qualification” or “Admission Grade” and whether they would go on to graduate or drop out of school. We can also see that most of our students are around 20 years old, although they range from ages 18 to 70 years old. Also, it’s worth noting that older students appeared more likely to drop out than younger students even though there wasn’t an obviously strong relationship. Next we found that a vast majority of our students were financially free and up to date on tuition fees. This is likely due to the student sampling process conducted; it’s likely that many students were attending international universities (specifically universities in Portugal) rather than in the U.S. where school is more expensive and many students take on student loan debt. Between these two variables we noticed that students who were behind on tuition fees were roughly, equally likely to be in debt or financially free, while students up to date on tuition fees were far more likely to be financially free. Ultimately, both variables had the strongest relationship with the students’ likelihood to graduate. Students in debt or behind on tuition fees were more likely to drop out than they were to graduate.\n\nGiven the information we gained through our exploratory analysis, we decided it best to move forward by focusing our regression analysis on the student factors we found most significant to our target variable.
