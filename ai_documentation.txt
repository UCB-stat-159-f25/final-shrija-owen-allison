Prompt 1 (ChatGPT): "how to change hue color scheme"
Response:
"""
You can change the hue color scheme in seaborn by using the palette= argument.

Here are the most common options and examples.

✅ 1. Pick a Named Seaborn Palette
sns.countplot(
    data=clean_sd,
    x="Target",
    hue="Debtor",
    palette="Set2"      # Try Set1, Set2, Set3, Pastel1, Paired, etc.
)


Popular palettes:
"Set1", "Set2", "Set3", "Pastel1", "Pastel2", "Paired", "Dark2", "muted".

✅ 2. Define Your Own Custom Colors
sns.countplot(
    data=clean_sd,
    x="Target",
    hue="Debtor",
    palette=["#1f77b4", "#ff7f0e"]   # custom HEX colors
)

✅ 3. Use a Sequential or Diverging Palette

If you want color intensity differences:

sns.countplot(
    data=clean_sd,
    x="Target",
    hue="Debtor",
    palette=sns.color_palette("Blues", 2)
)


Or diverging:

palette = sns.color_palette("coolwarm", 2)

sns.countplot(
    data=clean_sd,
    x="Target",
    hue="Debtor",
    palette=palette
)

✅ 4. Example With Clear Labels + Custom Palette
plt.figure(figsize=(7,5))

sns.countplot(
    data=clean_sd,
    x="Target",
    hue="Debtor",
    palette=["#66c2a5", "#fc8d62"]  # Teal and Orange
)

plt.title("Debtor Status vs Student Outcome")
plt.xlabel("Outcome")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.legend(title="Debtor", labels=["Financially Free", "Debtor"])

plt.show()


If you tell me the style or mood you want (professional, pastel, bold, high contrast), I can suggest the best palette for your project!

Prompt 2: (ChatGPT) Shrija: What are my color options for bar graphs?
Response:
"""
For bar graphs in Seaborn, you have several ways to control colors. Here’s a detailed overview:

1️⃣ Using palette in Seaborn

Seaborn supports a palette argument in functions like sns.barplot and sns.catplot. You can pass:

a) Named palettes (built-in)

sns.catplot(..., palette="deep")      # default
sns.catplot(..., palette="muted")
sns.catplot(..., palette="bright")
sns.catplot(..., palette="pastel")
sns.catplot(..., palette="dark")
sns.catplot(..., palette="colorblind")

b) Custom list of colors
You can specify exact colors for each hue level:
sns.catplot(..., palette=["#1f77b4", "#ff7f0e"])  # blue and orange

c) Color maps from Matplotlib
sns.catplot(..., palette="viridis")
sns.catplot(..., palette="coolwarm")
sns.catplot(..., palette="plasma")
sns.catplot(..., palette="Set2")

2️⃣ Using a single color for all bars
If you don’t want a hue distinction, you can set a single color:
sns.barplot(..., color="skyblue")

3️⃣ Custom palettes for categorical variables

You can define a dictionary mapping hue levels to colors:
palette = {"Mother": "skyblue", "Father": "orange"}
sns.catplot(..., palette=palette)

4️⃣ Using Matplotlib after plotting
for i, p in enumerate(ax.patches):
    p.set_color("#ff7f0e")  # orange

✅ Summary

Quick: use Seaborn built-in palettes (deep, muted, pastel, etc.)

Full control: provide a list of colors or a dictionary mapping hue levels

Can also use Matplotlib colormaps for gradients

Prompt 3 (Gemini) Shrija: "is previous qualification grade or an admission grade better when evaluating a student"
Response:
"""
In general, the previous qualification grade (e.g., high school GPA) is considered a better single predictor of future academic success in higher education than a specific "admission grade" or standardized test score. 
Here is a breakdown of why:

Previous Qualification Grade
Strongest Predictor: A student's day-to-day academic performance over a long period (like high school) is widely considered the most significant indicator of how they will perform in college.
Comprehensive Picture: Grades in previous courses provide a detailed story about a student's work ethic, their choices in course rigor, and their ability to manage responsibilities over time.
Consistency: Research suggests that high school GPA is a consistently strong predictor for not only freshman year performance, but also four-year outcomes, including cumulative grades and graduation rates.
Less Bias: Some studies argue that grades are less influenced by socioeconomic factors compared to standardized admission tests, providing a more equitable measure of potential. 

Admission Grade
Definition Varies: An "admission grade" can refer to different things, such as a specific entrance exam score (like the SAT/ACT), or a calculated score that combines previous grades and exam results.
Snapshot in Time: Standardized admission test scores are single-day assessments and may not capture a student's full potential due to factors like test anxiety or an off day.
Inconsistency in Prediction: While some research shows a positive correlation between entry/admission grades and early academic achievement, other studies find an inconsistent or only slightly positive, low correlation with long-term academic success.
Used as Part of a Whole: Admission grades/scores are typically just one component of a holistic review process, which also includes essays, recommendations, and the rigor of previous coursework. 

Conclusion
When evaluating a student, institutions generally find that previous qualification grades offer a more reliable and holistic measure of a student's capability and potential for sustained success in a rigorous academic environment. Both metrics, however, can provide valuable insights when used as part of a comprehensive evaluation process.
