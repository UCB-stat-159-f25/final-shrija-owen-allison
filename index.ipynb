    "\n",
    "This project aims to utilize data science techniques to dissect these complex relationships, moving beyond assumptions to find statistically significant predictors of whether a student will graduate or drop out. Student retention and academic success are critical metrics for higher education institutions, influencing both university rankings and the economic prospects of students. By analyzing student data institutions can better understand the underlying causes of attrition. "

    "Our team retieved this dataset on early academic success from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The dataset, tited \"Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success\", the dataset was constructed by consolidating several disjoint databases from a university. It contains features related to undergraduate students in fields such as agronomy, management, and nursing. The variables are divided into two categories: pre-enrollment features (academic path, demographics, socio-economic factors) and post-enrollment targets (academic performance in Semesters 1 and 2).\n",
